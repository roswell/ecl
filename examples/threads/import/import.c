 * GOAL:        To execute lisp code from threads which have not
 *              been generated by our lisp environment.
 *
 * ASSUMES:     ECL has been configured with threads (--enable-threads)
 *              and installed somewhere on the path.
 *
 * COMPILE:     Run "make" from the command line.
 *
 *
 * When this example is compiled and run, it generates a number of
 * threads, each one executing some interpreted code -- in this case
 * a bunch of PRINT statements.
 *
 * Importing other threads into lisp is possible if these threads have
 * been intercepted by the garbage collector. The way to do it is to
 * include the <ecl.h> on the source code that generates the threads,
 * as we do here. This takes care of replacing calls to phtread_create
 * or CreateThread (in unix and Windows respectively) with the
 * GC_pthread_create and GC_CreateThread functions.
