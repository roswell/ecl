;;; This an extremely simple example of how to build standalone programs and
;;; unified fasl files from a system definition file.  You should peruse this
;;; file and also test it by loading it on your copy of ECL.
;;;

;;;
;;; First of all, we need to include the ASDF module and the compiler
;;;

(require 'asdf)
(require 'cmp)

(setf *load-verbose* nil)
(setf *compile-verbose* nil)
(setf c::*suppress-compiler-warnings* t)
(setf c::*suppress-compiler-notes* t)

;;; This flag determines how lisp constants are compiled into the program.
;;; The default scheme does not work well in statically linked libraries
;;; yet.
(setf c::*compile-in-constants* t)

(push (make-pathname :name nil :type nil :version nil
                     :defaults *load-truename*)
      asdf:*central-registry*)

;;;
;;; This will show you what is running behind the walls of ASDF. Everything
;;; is built on top of the powerful C::BUILDER routine, which allows one
;;; to build anything from executables to shared libraries.
;;;
;;(trace c::builder)

;;;
;;; Now we attempt building a single FASL file containing all those files.
;;; Notice that we remove any previous fasl file.
;;;

(princ "

Building FASL file 'example.fasb'

")
(asdf:make-build :example :type :fasl :move-here "./")

;;;
;;; Now we load the previous file!
;;;

(princ "

Loading FASL file example.fasb

")
(load "example.fasb")

;;;
;;; Now that it worked, we attempt building a single program file with everything.
;;;

(princ "

Building standalone executable 'example-mono' ('example-mono.exe' in Windows)

")
(asdf:make-build :example
                 :type :program :epilogue-code '(ext:quit 0)
                 :move-here "./")

;;;
;;; Test the program
;;;

(princ "

Executing standalone file 'example'

")
(ext:system "./example")

;;;
;;; Clean up everything
;;;

(mapc #'delete-file (append (directory "*.o")
                            (directory "*.obj")
                            (directory "example-mono*")))
