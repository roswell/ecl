(docfun compiler:build-ecl function (program-name &rest components) "

Builds a standalone executable using the object files, libraries and flags
which follow PROGRAM-NAME, which is the name of the final executable.

Each argument in COMPONENTS can be either a symbol or a string. If it is a
string, it is passed as such to the C compiler when building the program. This
way you can specify FASL code (i.e. compiled lisp code) and additional
libraries or custom C code.

However, if the argument is a symbol, it is interpreted as the name of a lisp
library of FASL code. You should use symbols to call in optional parts of the
interpreter, such as the compiler 'CMP (not yet available)

For example:
        (compile-file \"my-code.lsp\" :system-p)
        (build-ecl \"my-ecl\" \"my-code.o\" \"-Bdynamic -lX11\" 'cmp)
builds an new interpreter with some custom lisp code given in \"my-code.o\" and
with the ECL compiler (You must explicitely mention the compiler if you want
it). Finally, the X-Windows dynamically linked libraries are also included
because \"my-code.lsp\" uses the foreign function interface to do some
graphics.")

For the load operation, in alternative to the default of loading all the

specifiable via the optional parameter MODE, which can be
:QUERY and :SOURCE.
The latter option will load the sources of the system, while with :QUERY
the user will be prompted on each file to be loaded.

The default mode for compilation is to compile just the files which need
to be recompiled according to their dependencies.
With the :FORCE option, all the files are recompiled, while with the
