@node Atomic operations
@subsection Atomic operations
ECL supports both compare-and-swap and fetch-and-add (which may be
faster on some processors) atomic operations on a number of different
places. The compare-and-swap macro is user extensible with a protocol
similar to @code{setf}.

@subsubheading C Reference
@cppindex ecl_compare_and_swap
@deftypefun cl_object ecl_compare_and_swap (cl_object *slot, cl_object old, cl_object new)

Perform an atomic compare and swap operation on @var{slot} and return
the previous value stored in @var{slot}. If the return value is equal
to @var{old} (comparison by @code{==}), the operation has succeeded.
This is a inline-only function defined in ``ecl/ecl_atomics.h''.
@end deftypefun

@cppindex ecl_atomic_incf
@deftypefun cl_object ecl_atomic_incf (cl_object *slot, cl_object increment)
@end deftypefun
@cppindex ecl_atomic_incf_by_fixnum
@deftypefun cl_object ecl_atomic_incf_by_fixnum (cl_object *slot, cl_fixnum increment)

Atomically increment @var{slot} by the given increment and return the
previous value stored in @var{slot}. The consequences are undefined if
the value of @var{slot} is not of type @code{fixnum}.
@code{ecl_atomic_incf} signals an error if @var{increment} is not of
type @code{fixnum}. This is a inline-only function defined in
``ecl/ecl_atomics.h''.
@end deftypefun

@cppindex ecl_atomic_index_incf
@deftypefun cl_index ecl_atomic_index_incf (cl_index *slot);

Atomically increment @var{slot} by 1 and return the new value stored
in @var{slot}.
@end deftypefun

@cppindex ecl_atomic_get
@deftypefun cl_object ecl_atomic_get (cl_object *slot)

Perform a volatile load of the object in @var{slot} and then
atomically set @var{slot} to @code{ECL_NIL}. Returns the value
previously stored in @var{slot}.
@end deftypefun

@cppindex ecl_atomic_push
@deftypefun void ecl_atomic_push (cl_object *slot, cl_object o)
@end deftypefun
@cppindex ecl_atomic_pop
@deftypefun cl_object ecl_atomic_pop (cl_object *slot)

Like push/pop but atomic.
@end deftypefun

@subsubheading Lisp Reference
@lspindex mp:atomic-incf
@defmac mp:atomic-incf place &optional (increment 1)
@end defmac
@lspindex mp:atomic-decf
@defmac mp:atomic-decf place &optional (increment 1)

Atomically increments/decrements the fixnum stored in @var{place} by
the given @var{increment} and returns the value of @var{place} before
the increment. Incrementing and decrementing is done using modular
arithmetic, so that @code{mp:atomic-incf} of a place whose value is
@code{most-positive-fixnum} by 1 results in
@code{most-negative-fixnum} stored in place.

Currently the following places are supported:

@code{car}, @code{cdr}, @code{first}, @code{rest}, @code{svref},
@code{symbol-value}, @code{slot-value},
@code{clos:standard-instance-access},
@code{clos:funcallable-standard-instance-access}.

For @code{slot-value}, the object should have no applicable methods
defined for @code{slot-value-using-class} or @code{(setf
slot-value-using-class)}.

The consequences are undefined if the value of @var{place} is not of
type @code{fixnum}.
@end defmac

@lspindex mp:compare-and-swap
@defmac mp:compare-and-swap place old new

Atomically stores @var{new} in @var{place} if @var{old} is @code{eq}
to the current value of @var{place}. Returns the previous value of
@var{place}: if the returned value is @code{eq} to @var{old}, the swap
was carried out.

Currently, the following places are supported:

@code{car}, @code{cdr}, @code{first}, @code{rest}, @code{svref},
@code{symbol-plist}, @code{symbol-value}, @code{slot-value},
@code{clos:standard-instance-access},
@code{clos:funcallable-standard-instance-access}, a structure slot
accessor@footnote{The creation of atomic structure slot accessors can be
deactivated by supplying a @code{(:atomic-accessors nil)} option to
@code{defstruct}.} or any other place for which a compare-and-swap
expansion was defined by @code{mp:defcas} or
@code{mp:define-cas-expander}.

For @code{slot-value}, @code{slot-unbound} is called if the slot is
unbound unless @var{old} is @code{eq} to @code{si:unbound}, in which
case @var{old} is returned and @var{new} is assigned to the slot.
Additionally, the object should have no applicable methods defined for
@code{slot-value-using-class} or @code{(setf slot-value-using-class)}.
@end defmac

@lspindex mp:atomic-update
@defmac mp:atomic-update place update-fn &rest arguments

Atomically updates the CAS-able @var{place} to the value returned by
calling @var{update-fn} with @var{arguments} and the old value of
@var{place}. @var{update-fn} must be a function accepting @code{(1+
(length arguments))} arguments. Returns the new value which was stored
in @var{place}.

@var{place} may be read and @var{update-fn} may be called more than
once if multiple threads are trying to write to @var{place} at the
same time.

@exindex Atomic update of a structure slot
Example:

Atomic update of a structure slot. If the update would not be atomic,
the result would be unpredictable.
@lisp
(defstruct test-struct
  (slot1 0))
(let ((struct (make-test-struct)))
  (mapc #'mp:process-join
        (loop repeat 100
           collect (mp:process-run-function
                    ""
                    (lambda ()
                      (loop repeat 1000 do
                           (mp:atomic-update (test-struct-slot1 struct) #'1+)
                           (sleep 0.00001))))))
  (test-struct-slot1 struct))
=> 100000
@end lisp
@end defmac

@lspindex mp:atomic-push
@defmac mp:atomic-push obj place
@end defmac
@lspindex mp:atomic-pop
@defmac mp:atomic-pop place

Like @code{push}/@code{pop}, but atomic. @var{place} must be CAS-able
and may be read multiple times before the update succeeds.
@end defmac

@lspindex mp:define-cas-expander
@defmac mp:define-cas-expander accessor lambda-list &body body

Define a compare-and-swap expander similar to
@code{define-setf-expander}. Defines the compare-and-swap-expander for
generalized-variables @code{(accessor ...)}. When a form
@code{(mp:compare-and-swap (accessor arg1 ... argn) old new)} is
evaluated, the forms given in the body of
@code{mp:define-cas-expander} are evaluated in order with the
parameters in @code{lambda-list} bound to @code{arg1 ... argn}. The
body must return six values
@lisp
(var1 ... vark)
(form1 ... formk)
old-var
new-var
compare-and-swap-form
volatile-access-form
@end lisp
in order (Note that @code{old-var} and @code{new-var} are single
variables, unlike in @code{define-setf-expander}). The whole
@code{compare-and-swap} form is then expanded into
@lisp
(let* ((var1 from1) ... (vark formk)
       (old-var old-form)
       (new-var new-form))
  compare-and-swap-form).
@end lisp
Note that it is up to the user of this macro to ensure atomicity for
the resulting compare-and-swap expansions.

@exindex CAS expansion definition
Example:

CAS expansion for @code{mp:process-name}. A process is defined as
follows in C:
@example
@verbatim
struct ecl_process {
        _ECL_HDR;
        cl_object name;
        cl_object function;
        ...
};
@end verbatim
@end example

Hence we can define a CAS expander as (omitting type checks):
@lisp
(mp:define-cas-expander mp:process-name (x)
  (let ((old (gensym)) (new (gensym)))
    (values nil nil old new
            `(ffi:c-inline (,x ,old ,new) (:object :object :object) :object
                           "ecl_compare_and_swap(&(#0)->process.name,#1,#2)"
                           :one-liner t)
            `(mp:process-name ,x))))
@end lisp
@end defmac

@lspindex mp:defcas
@defmac mp:defcas accessor cas-fun &optional documentation

Define a compare-and-swap expansion similar to the short form
of @code{defsetf}. Defines an expansion
@lisp
(compare-and-swap (accessor arg1 ... argn) old new)
=> (cas-fun arg1 ... argn old new)
@end lisp
Note that it is up to the user of this macro to ensure atomicity for
the resulting compare-and-swap expansions.
@end defmac

@lspindex mp:remcas
@defun mp:remcas symbol

Remove a compare-and-swap expansion. It is an equivalent of
@code{fmakunbound (setf symbol)} for cas expansions.
@end defun

@lspindex mp:get-cas-expansion
@defun mp:get-cas-expansion place &optional environment

Returns the compare-and-swap expansion forms and variables as
defined in @code{mp:define-cas-expander} for @var{place} as six values.
@end defun
