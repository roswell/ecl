@section Evaluation and compilation

@subsection Compiler declaration @code{OPTIMIZE}
@cindex Compiler declarations
@lspindex optimize
@lspindex debug
@lspindex speed
@lspindex safety
@lspindex space

The @code{OPTIMIZE} declaration includes three concepts: @code{DEBUG},
@code{SPEED}, @code{SAFETY} and @code{SPACE}. Each of these declarations
can take one of the integer values 0, 1, 2 and 3. According to these
values, the implementation may decide how to compile or interpret a given
lisp form.

ECL currently does not use all these declarations, but some of them
definitely affect the speed and behavior of compiled functions. For
instance, the @code{DEBUG} declaration, as shown in
@ref{tab:optimize-debug}, the value of debugging is zero, the function
will not appear in the debugger and, if redefined, some functions might
not see the redefinition.

@end float

A bit more critical is the value of @code{SAFETY} because as shown in
@ref{tab:optimize-safety}, it may affect the safety checks generated
by the compiler. In particular, in some circumstances the compiler may
assume that the arguments to a function are properly typed. For
instance, if you compile with a low value of @code{SAFETY}, and invoke
@code{RPLACA} with an object which is not a list, the consequences are
unspecified.

@item The compiler generates type checks for the arguments of a lambda form, thus enforcing any type declaration written by the user.

@item The slots or fields in a lisp object are accessed directly without type checks even if the type of the object could not be inferred (see line above). Affects functions like @code{PATHNAME-TYPE}, @code{CAR}, @code{REST}, etc.

@subsection @code{declaim} and @code{proclaim}
Declarations established with @code{proclaim} stay in force
indefinitely. Declarations established with @code{declaim} in a file
do not persist after the file has been compiled. However, they are
established with @code{proclaim} at load time when the compiled file
is loaded. This means that when compiling two files, @code{declaim}
declarations in the first file will not be in force when compiling the
second file unless the first file was loaded before the second one was
compiled.

@subsection C Reference

@cppindex ecl_process_env
@deftypefn {@cind{}} cl_object cl_env_ptr ()
ECL stores information about each thread on a dedicated structure, which
is the process environment. A pointer to this structure can be retrieved
using the function or macro above. This pointer can be used for a
variety of tasks, such as defining special variable bindings,
controlling interrupts, retrieving function output values, etc.
