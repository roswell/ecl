;;; SLOT ACCESSORS
;;;
;;; The following functions deal with an ECL extension, which are
;;; sealed slots.  These slots have a fixed location which is
;;; inherited by subclasses. They normally appear when you add the
;;; option (:sealedp t) to a class definition.
;;;
;;; When ECL detects that you call an accessor to such a slot, it can
;;; optimize the operation, using a direct access based on the
;;; position of the slot. This optimization is only active when the
;;; safety levels are low, because it prevents you from changing the
;;; class hierarchy.
