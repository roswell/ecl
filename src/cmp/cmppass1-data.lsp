;;;;  Each lisp compiled file consists on code and a data section. Whenever an
;;;;  #'in-package toplevel form is found, a read-time evaluated expression is
;;;;  inserted in the data section which changes the current package for the
;;;;  rest of it. This way it is possible to save some space by writing the
;;;;  symbol's package only when it does not belong to the current package.
