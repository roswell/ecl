;;;; Contains: Multithreading API regression tests

(in-package :cl-test)

(suite 'mp)

;;; Important Note:
;;;
;;; Testing multithreading primitives such as locks or semaphores
;;; often requires synchronizing multiple threads. To keep the tests
;;; as simple as possible, this is synchronization is often done by
;;; using busy waits. As a consequence, test failures may manifest as
;;; timeouts. Some tests for semaphores and barriers also use mutexes
;;; for synchronization purposes and will fail if mutexes don't work
;;; correctly. Nearly all tests also assume that creating, killing or
;;; joining threads works properly, which is not tested separately.


;; Locks

;;; Date: 04/09/2009
;;; From: Matthew Mondor

;;; Description:
;;;
;;;     When a WITH-LOCK is interrupted, it is not able to release
;;;     the resulting lock and an error is signaled.
